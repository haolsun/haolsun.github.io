== About me 
I am an associate professor at [https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/ School of Software], [https://www.sdu.edu.cn Shandong University]. I obtained my PhD degree (2020) and Bachelor degree (2014) in engineering from Shandong University under the supervision of Prof. Yilong Yin. I have also studied in Prof. Shuo Li’s group at Western University, CA in 2016 as the visiting student. After that, I was supported by China Scholarship Council (CSC) and spent one and half years at University of Wisconsin-Madison, under the supervision of Prof. Vikas Singh. Besides, I pursued an internship at Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence (IIAI), UAE.

My research interests span both machine learning and computer vision, including meta-learning, weakly supervised learning, generative model, etc.
